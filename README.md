jregex
======

This is a Maven-friendly version of jregex, by Sergey A. Samokhodkin. I pulled
a copy of jregex 1.2_01 and Maven-ized it to get rid of the spam about an old
compiler and inner classes that was messing up my Android builds.

No code has been changed in the actual archive, though you should keep an eye
on behavior when porting from the original jregex because you'll probably build
with a newer compiler. I have not run into problems, however.

You can get the original jregex at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/jregex
